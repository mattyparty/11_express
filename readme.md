# Project Name: Express Note Taker

# Project Description

Using the provided code I was tasked with building a Note Taker. I created both HTML and API routes in order to route the traffic to the appropriate area.

## HTML Routes

I found these to be rather simple. Essentially listening for the URL call and diverting to the static HTML Page

## API Routes

This one was alot more trickier for me. I was able to get it working. Understanding the concept was not the problem more the syntax.

## Heroku Deployment

This was pretty straight forward but i did subsitute "git push heroku HEAD:master" for "git push master Heroku" and was able to deploy
